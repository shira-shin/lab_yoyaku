# Production DB Push Attempt

I attempted to follow the instructions to create the missing Prisma tables on the production database.

## Steps Attempted

1. Navigated to the `web` workspace directory.
2. Tried to pull the Vercel environment variables with `vercel env pull --environment production --yes --token "$VERCEL_TOKEN" .env.from-vercel`.
3. Encountered `vercel: command not found` because the Vercel CLI was not available.
4. Attempted to install the Vercel CLI with `npm i -g vercel@latest`.
5. Received an `E403 Forbidden` error from the npm registry, which prevented installing the CLI, so the environment variables could not be pulled.

## Current Status

Because the Vercel CLI could not be installed in this environment, it was not possible to pull the production environment variables or execute the Prisma `db push`. As a result, the production database remains unchanged.

## Next Steps for Completion

The operations can be completed manually from an environment that has access to the npm registry:

1. Install the Vercel CLI (`npm i -g vercel@latest`).
2. Run `vercel env pull --environment production --yes --token "$VERCEL_TOKEN" .env.from-vercel` to retrieve the production environment variables.
3. Source the pulled environment file (`set -a; source .env.from-vercel; set +a`).
4. Execute `pnpm prisma db push --skip-generate --accept-data-loss --force-reset --url "$DIRECT_URL"` to create the missing tables.
5. Verify the tables exist in Neon using the provided `to_regclass` query.
6. Confirm that the `/api/groups?mine=1` and `/api/me/reservations` endpoints return HTTP 200 in production.

If these steps are performed from a machine with proper network access, the Prisma schema should be applied and the dashboard errors should clear.
